Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

<img src="https://gdoc.io/uploads/Simple-mind-map-template-web-984x712.webp" width="100" align="right" height="200" alt="logo">
              <p>Before starting a feature story, you want to brainstorm different ideas for the story. What is the story going to be about? Is there a certain group, event, or job that you are interested in writing about? What part of your main idea would you focus on? For example A feature story on campus police, the focus being campus safety. Using a mind map is a great way to help you figure this all out.

              <h3>Do Some Research</h3>
              <p> Research your idea, and make sure you get everything that you possibly can from your research. You can use this information as a cross reference to your interviews, and you can use this information later on in your story. Make sure you are using trusted websites, and you write down website names in case you do use information from one of the websites in your story you can properly cite it.

              <p>Once you have your idea and focus, you then have to write questions. Depending on what you need, five to ten questions is a great start! You should write the questions down in a little notebook for you to access during the interviews. If you don’t know how to write interview questions, this video has a great step by step guide.

              <h3>Contacting Your Sources</h3>
              <p>Now that you have your feature story idea, and interview questions, you actually have to contact your sources. Most people you want to contact can probably be found on the internet. Look up the company, or group, and on their website there will be contact information. If you know people in the area you are focusing on, you can ask them for help in finding people to interview. For most cases, start with an email, if in a day or two they dont answer, call them. If that doesn’t get you anywhere just go to their place of work. You have to be a little pushy when being a journalist.

              <h3>Conducting the Interviews</h3>
              <ul class="list-of-items">
              <li><h2>When doing interviews there are a few tips to take into account</h2></li>
              <li>try to interview someone at their place of work, instead of a common area. It helps you get a sense of what they are like, and you can draw inspiration from their place of work to write your story.</li>
              <li>Have a recording device with you, make sure your source is aware that you will be recording. This is so you can have accurate quotes, and you have proof later on if your source tries to say they didn’t say something.</li>
              <li>Develop  a shorthand way of note taking. You don’t always want to rely on your technology.</li>
              <li>Keep a cool head. If you're nervous, your source will be nervous. In fact, start your interview by asking a few questions just to get to know your source. You want to make them comfortable, and jumping straight into an interview will make them nervous.</li>
              <li>Mimic your source's body language. If they are loose and laid back, then feel free to be as well, if they are serious and straight back, then you should also act in such a way.</li>
              <li>Try and make it flow like a conversation, not just asking questions and getting your answer. If you make it more personable, and learn to know them as a person, it is going to make your story more personable.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
          </li>

	<li>
	   <div class= "content">
	     <h3>Composing Your Information</h3>
		<p> Compose all your notes and information together, see what you have and what you can do with it. You can use this time to identify good quotes to use in your story. Those would be anything memorable, or something you are unable to say yourself. Find the main points of your story, what information is more important, and also what information is almost like a subheading to your main points. Make sure you have proof for everything you want to mention in your story.</p>

	</li>

	<li>
	   <div class= "content">
	     <h3>Write your Lead</h3>
		<p> Your lead is the most important part of your story. It is what draws your reader in, and introduces your story. There are many different leads you can do. Such as… </p>
		<ul class= "stepSeven">
		<li>Anecdotal lead</li>
		<li>Literary Allusion lead</li>
		<li>Historical Allusion lead</li>
		<li>Description lead </li>
		<li>Creative lead</li>
		<li>Analogy lead</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

<li>
	   <div class= "content">
	     <h3>Writing the Rest of Your Story</h3>
		<p>While writing the rest of your story, make sure you have all your assets mentioned, and you have all the correct information. Triple check the spelling of people’s names, and of buildings or cooperations. Create a small outline of how you want the information to flow. One thing to keep in mind while writing your feature story is that you want to show your facts, you don’t want to tell them. In fact, keep yourself out of your writing to the best of your ability. The writing doesn’t have to be perfect in this step, just get everything written down.</p>

	     <h3>Editing</h3>
		<p>This is where your story actually comes to life. You want to spend more time editing than you did writing the story. In this step you want to make sure that your story actually sounds Goldowitz, you have all the correct grammar, correct spelling, and are using proper AP formatting. Check the information that you have in this step, you don’t want to have misleading information. Add your pictures, make sure that they have correct attributions and are credited.
